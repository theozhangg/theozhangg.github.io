👋 Hello! I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UCLA. 

✍️ My work broadly covers the ethical applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am interested in examining biases introduced to these machine learning models and pipelines through implicit biases and errors in the development process. I would like to eventually work in the tech policy sector to ensure that our communities are protected and properly served by artificial intelligence rather than exploited.

💬 I am a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://spog.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA Speech and Cognitive Development Lab (SPOG)</a> with Assistant Professor Meg Cychosz. My work is focused on creating self-supervised machine learning models to automatically classify child speech vocalizations. Take a look at my <a href="https://theozhangg.github.io/publications/" target="_blank">publications</a> page for more information on my current research project!

🤖 I am also the President of IEEE at UCLA, the largest engineering club on campus. If you are curious about the wonderful work we do, check out the <a href="https://ieeebruins.com/" target="_blank">IEEE at UCLA website</a>.

📖 Outside of academics, I love to read sci-fi and contemporary, write, sew, and run really slowly!
