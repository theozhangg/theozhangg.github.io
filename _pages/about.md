üëã Hello! I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UCLA. 

‚úçÔ∏è My work broadly covers the ethical applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am interested in examining biases introduced to these machine learning models and pipelines through implicit biases and errors in the development process. I would like to eventually work in the tech policy sector to ensure that our communities are protected and properly served by artificial intelligence rather than exploited.

üí¨ I am a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://spog.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">UCLA Speech and Cognitive Development Lab (SPOG)</a> with Assistant Professor Meg Cychosz. My work is focused on creating self-supervised machine learning models to automatically classify child speech vocalizations. We currently have a paper under review!

ü§ñ I am also the President of IEEE at UCLA, the largest engineering club on campus and the largest IEEE Student Branch in the nation. If you are curious about the wonderful work we do, check out the <a href="https://ieeebruins.com/" target="_blank">IEEE at UCLA website</a>.

üìñ Outside of academics, I love to read sci-fi and contemporary, write about the intersection of technology and society, make physical art, and explore new places!

‚úèÔ∏è I'm starting a <a href="https://theozhangg.github.io/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a> where I will focus on the intersection of technology, society, and media. Keep an eye out for my first blog post, coming soon!

# More about my experiences:
## Research/Work
**Research Assistant | January 2024 ‚Äì Present**  
**Speech and Cognitive Development Lab at UCLA**  
* Developed deep learning classification models (PyTorch, TensorFlow), leveraging transfer learning to analyze infant speech development and assess speech maturity levels across 25+ languages
* Processed and curated large-scale speech datasets (53K+ samples) from a novel 200K+ sample corpus (the largest cross-linguistic child speech corpus to date), ensuring balanced dataset splits by age, language, and recording environment
* Benchmarked model performance against human annotators, exploring transfer learning and phonetic-tuning techniques to improve classification accuracy on naturalistic audio
* Co-first author on a paper currently under review

**Senior Data Science Intern and Summer Research Fellow	| June 2024 ‚Äì September 2024**  
**UCSF Archives and Special Collections**  
* Conducted a research project on biases introduced by optical character recognition (OCR) tools in the digital archival process and subsequent datasets
* Evaluated multiple OCR tools (Tesseract, AWS Textract, Google Document AI) using NLP methods (spaCy, NLTK) and developed custom evaluation pipelines to assess accuracy, speed, and downstream impact on sentiment, topic modeling, and entity extraction
* First authored and published a paper, ‚ÄúSilence in OCR: What Could Handwritten Documents Tell Us?‚Äù 
* Created reproducible datasets and analysis pipelines for the UCSF Digital Health Humanities Institute, supporting future workshops and classes on ethical AI and archival research

**ML/AI Engineering Intern | August 2023 ‚Äì December 2023**  
**GumGum**  
* Developed deep learning models (PyTorch) to classify non-speech audio events in video content, expanding GumGum‚Äôs contextual advertising capabilities beyond speech analysis
* Integrated sound event detection into GumGum‚Äôs audio processing pipeline, enabling multi-label classification aligned with industry-standard IAB content categories
* Applied transfer learning using pretrained audio neural networks (PANNs) to optimize model performance on real-world video datasets for content and brand safety use cases

**Software Engineering Intern | June 2022 ‚Äì September 2022**  
**Athenic AI**  
* Developed an SMS/email notification and file upload system (React.js), improving customer insights in AI-driven analytics
* Refactored frontend codebase, optimizing backend performance by 50%
* Resolved over 30 frontend and backend tickets to improve user experience of product development
