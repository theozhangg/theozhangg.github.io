üëã Hello! I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UCLA. 

‚úçÔ∏è My work broadly covers the ethical applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am interested in examining biases introduced to these machine learning models and pipelines through implicit biases and errors in the development process. I would like to eventually work in the tech policy sector to ensure that our communities are protected and properly served by artificial intelligence rather than exploited.

üí¨ I am a Research Assistant at the [UCLA Speech and Cognitive Development Lab (SPOG)](https://spog.ucla.edu/) with Assistant Professor Meg Cychosz. My work is focused on creating self-supervised machine learning models to automatically classify child speech vocalizations. Take a look at my [publications](https://theozhangg.github.io/publications/) page for more information on my current research project!

ü§ñ I am also the President of IEEE at UCLA, the largest engineering club on campus. If you are curious about the wonderful work we do, check out the [IEEE at UCLA website](https://ieeebruins.com/). If you would like to see past projects I've worked on at IEEE, check out my [projects/experience page](https://theozhangg.github.io/projects/).

üìñ Outside of academics, I love to read sci-fi and contemporary, write, sew, and run really slowly!
