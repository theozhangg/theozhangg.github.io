title: "Employing self-supervised learning models for cross-linguistic child speech maturity classification"

permalink: /publication/child-speech-maturity
excerpt: 'Classifying child speech vocalizations are a reliable way to track child speech maturity, but doing so requires extensive professional experience and resources which thus prevents underserved populations from accessing care that would identify at-risk children with speech delays and disorder. We apply self-supervised learning models, including existing and novel transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, to the fundamental yet outstanding classification task of identifying child vocalizations.'

Speech technology systems struggle with many downstream tasks for child speech due to small training corpora and the difficulties that the physical properties of child speech pose. We apply self-supervised learning models, including existing and novel transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, to a fundamental yet outstanding classification task: identifying child vocalizations. Models were trained to distinguish between cry, laughter, mature speech (consonant+vowel), and immature speech (just consonant or vowel). Training was conducted on a large dataset of maximally ecologically-valid child vocalizations, orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets employed for this task. Data were sampled from audio recordings of children acquiring 25+ languages in rural and urban sites in the U.S., Bolivia, Mexico, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and France. The proposed transformer-based model outperformed the CNN and previous models, achieved classification accuracy comparable to human annotators, and was robust across rural and urban child rearing settings.
